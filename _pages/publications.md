<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> Magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) is a novel reliable technique with excellent potential for thermal therapies and treating breast tumours. This method involves injecting a magnetic nanofluid into the tumour and applying an external AC magnetic field to induce heat in the magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and raise the tumour temperature to ablation temperature ranges. Because of the complexity of considering and coupling all different physics involves in this phenomenon and also due to the intricacy of a thorough FEM numerical study, few FEM-based studies address the entire MFH process as similar to reality as possible. The current study investigates a FEM-based three-dimensional numerical simulation of MFH of breast tumours as a multi-physics problem. An anatomically realistic breast phantom (ARBP) is considered, some magnetic nanofluid is injected inside the tumour, and the diffusion phenomenon is simulated. Then, the amount of heat generated in the MNP-saturated tumour area due to an external AC magnetic field is simulated. In the end, the fraction of tumour tissue necrotized by this temperature rise is evaluated. The study’s results demonstrate that by injecting nanofluid and utilizing seven circular copper windings with each coil carrying 400 A current with a frequency of 400 kHz for generating the external AC magnetic field, the temperature in tumour tissue can be raised to a maximum of about 51.4°C, which leads to necrosis of entire tumour tissue after 30 minutes of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure. This numerical platform can depict all four various physics involved in the MFH of breast tumours by numerically solving all different equation sets coupled together with high precision. Thus, the proposed model can be utilized by clinicians as a reliable tool for predicting and identifying the approximate amount of temperature rise and the necrotic fraction of breast tumour, which can be very useful to opt for the best MFH therapeutic procedure and conditions based on various patients. In future works, this numerical platform’s results should be compared with experimental in-vivo results to improve and modify this platform in order to be ready for clinical applications.</p></span></ul>

<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> The development of refrigeration systems using thermo-acoustic technology is a novel solution for achieving environmentally friendly refrigerators. A full transient CFD method is introduced here that can resemble the whole thermo-acoustic phenomena along with its different governing physics as a whole. The working fluid contributes critically to the thermo-acoustic refrigerators’ cooling performance. In this paper, unlike previous researches, all different possible combinations of noble gases are considered and the performance of the refrigerator from both aspects of cooling temperature and COPR are investigated to determine the optimized gas mixture among all combinations. For this purpose, the effect of the sound intensity and the fluid’s Prandtl number as two key factors are investigated on the refrigeration performance. By considering a 2D-axisymmetric computational geometry resembling the real model, it is tried to attain results as reliable as possible. COMSOL software is used to perform the simulations. It is concluded that from the aspect of the cooling temperature, a sample with the highest sound intensity (pure He sample in this research) is the best. But, from the aspect of a higher COPR (relative coefficient of performance), a sample with the lowest Pr number (72%He–28%Xe sample in this research) would be the best. The lowest cooling temperature which is achieved by the pure He sample was about 273 K and the highest COPR which belongs to 72%He–28%Xe sample was approximately 0.335.</p></span></ul>

<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> <br>
<i>Background and objective</i><br>
Microwave-induced thermoacoustic imaging (MITAI) represents an innovative imaging approach for detection of breast cancer at initial phases by integrating the benefits provided by procedures of microwave and ultrasound imaging. The present investigation examines an innovative three-dimensional numerical modeling of MITAI as a problem with multi-physics nature.<br>
<i>Methods</i><br>
Simulations are performed by the use of COMSOL software. An anatomically realistic breast phantom representing various parts of a real breast, such as three different types of tissue, fibro-connective/glandular, transitional; and fatty, is taken into consideration along with a tumor. This breast phantom with a tumor is irradiated by a 2.45 GHz pulsed rectangular waveguide. The temperature increase and its consequent pressure caused by electromagnetic absorption are analyzed.<br>
<i>Results</i><br>
More temperature increase occurs in the tumor area than in the other parts of the breast, the fact which results in further increase in the pressure in the tumor area than other parts. This makes the tumor distinguishable. The ability of the MITAI process regarding the tumor size, shape (both geometrical shape and spatial orientation), location, the irradiation power level, and the pulse width is also investigated. It is demonstrated that tumor size does not have a significant impact on the efficiency of detection. In fact, very small tumors in the early stages of cancer development (with a radius of 0.25 cm) are also detectable by employing the MITAI technique. The geometrical shape of the tumor does not considerably affect the detecting performance just by itself. The spatial orientation of the tumor actually has a great impact on it. The location of the tumor is an essential factor involved in detection efficiency of MITAI. Tumors located in the fatty tissues would be much easier to be detected than those in the glandular tissues. Moreover, results denote that with augmentation of the irradiation power level or increasing the pulse width, stronger acoustic waves would be produced to make tumor detection easier.<br>
<i>Conclusion</i><br>
These modeling and techniques may be applied aiming for determination of the amount of the generated pressure differences and acoustic pressure magnitude, and can be utilized as an effective prognosticator in practical tests.</p></span></ul>

<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> Microwave-induced thermoacoustic imaging (MITAI) is an imaging technique with great potential for detecting breast cancer at early stages. Thermoacoustic imaging (TAI) combines the advantages of both microwave and ultrasound imaging techniques. In the current study, a three-dimensional novel numerical simulation of TAI phenomenon as a multi-physics problem is investigated. In the computational domain, a biological breast tissue including three different tissue types along with a tumor is placed in a tank containing castor oil and is irradiated by a 2.45-GHz pulsed microwave source from a rectangular waveguide. The generated heat in the biological tissue due to the electromagnetic wave irradiation and its corresponding pressure gradient in the tissue because of the temperature variations are evaluated. Also, capability of the MITAI process with respect to the tumor location and size is investigated. To identify the required power level needed for producing thermoacoustic signals, different power levels of microwave sources are investigated. The study’s results demonstrate a minuscule increase in temperature as a result of the absorption of pulsed microwave energy (for example, a maximum of 0.002472 °C temperature increase in tumor with 1 cm diameter which is located in fatty tissue of breast are obtained due to an excitation pulse of 1000 W, 1 ms). This small temperature variation in the tumor produces several kilopascals of pressure variations with maximum of 0.584016 kPa in tumor. This pressure variation will produce acoustic signals, which can be detected with an array of transducers and be used for image construction. Results demonstrate that the location of tumor in breast plays a vital role on the detecting performance of MITAI. Also, it is shown that very small tumors (with the diameter of 0.5 cm) can also be detected using MITAI technique. These simulations and procedures can be used for determining the amount of produced pressure variation, the acoustic pressure magnitude, and other complicated geometries.</p></span></ul>

<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> A thermoacoustic cooler uses sound waves to transfer heat from a cold to a hot region. The stack operates as a medium of this heat transfer and plays a vital role in the cooling performance of these systems. The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of geometrical parameters and thermophysical properties of the stack on the cooling performance of a standing wave thermoacoustic refrigerator and determine most efficient stack geometry and the material. The geometrical parameters studied are the thickness and length of stack plates and the distance between them. The thermophysical properties studied are heat capacity and thermal conductivity of stack plate. To investigate the effects of these parameters, various samples were numerically analyzed in 2D space by the use of COMSOL software. Simulation results demonstrate that reducing thickness and thermal conductivity of the stack plates lead to lower cooling temperatures and higher coefficients of performance (COPs) at an equal temperature difference. Moreover, there are optimum values for the amount of distance between two stack plates and length of the stack, in which a lower cooling temperature and higher COP at equal temperature difference will be obtained. The lowest cooling temperature obtained in simulated samples is approximately −12 °C.</p></span></ul>

Due to multi-physics nature of this phenomenon, the capability and feasibility of a numerical simulation method which can solve this problem consistently, investigated with performing a two dimensional simulation of TAI.

<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> In this research, the effect of adding (inner or outer) transverse and longitudinal grooves on the energy absorption characteristics of cylindrical aluminium tubes has been studied experimentally and numerically. In the beginning, the samples were simulated by LS-Dyna software. Then, the most efficient samples in terms of the amount of specific energy were tested to verify the results of the simulation. In the experiments, 13 samples were tested and to ensure the results, the test was repeated for each sample. It was observed that creating a transverse groove lead to 15% reduction in the maximum collapse force. It was also observed that the creation of longitudinal grooves lead to the reduction of the maximum collapse force. So that with more longitudinal grooves, the reduction of the specific energy and maximum force will be greater. According to the results, specific energy of the samples with one transverse groove in the upper part of the tube was higher than the samples with a transverse groove at the bottom of the tube. The results showed that samples with both transverse and longitudinal internal grooves had more specific energy compared to similar samples with external grooves.</p></span></ul>
